# ACC15_Cloud
Cloud Computing project done by Group ACC15.

The Group has created a BENCHOP as a service cloud application that provides the user with a service to calculate benchmarks with different methods for different problems.

The technical solution can be found in the BENCHOP folder.

The project report can be found as 'Final Report - group ACC15.pdf'

## ABSTRACT ##
The aim of this project was to design and create a scalable cloud architecture running the benchmark
as a service. With the implementation of flask, celery and docker we created a scalable benchmark
as a service application for a user who wants to calculate different benchmarking problems with
the help of different methods. The service created can easily be modified and enlarged depending
on the needs of the user.
